this project has 2 parts 

server
client

after cloning the source npm install command should be run inside the both server and client folders.
after a successfull dependency installation both can be run by
npm run command.

it is worth mentioning that the image folder and database are automatically created and managed
by server so there is need to take cate of them as n-pm run will take care of them.
