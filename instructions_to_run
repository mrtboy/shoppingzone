to run server)

after you clone the code, in the server directory run the following command to install the dependencies:
npm install
then after a successfull dependency insstallation you may run the following command to run the server:
npm start

its worth mentioning that currently the server is serving at port 2000, so you can check it out at:
localhost:2000
an example for an api at the moment is:
http://localhost:2000/tasks
which you need to utilize it using http get verb, in this case your browser may be helpful.

mongodb)
in the case you need to run the server code on your machine you have to be aware of existense of mongo server on your machine.
following few steps could be helpful in order to run mongo server:

1)installation of compatible mongo server
2)creation of folder called data on your c drive in the case you are running your code on window or hosting directory on linux
3)navigate to bin folder, then run mongod
