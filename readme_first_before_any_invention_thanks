A few hints before you start you work:

1)server and client code are completely separated, so if you are intented to work on either of
them you dont need to mess with the other one, e.g if you are working on the client side, you can download
server code to test your client server related functionality, but you should not make any changes to server code.

2)view generations and client side interations are all handled by vue engine, no ssr(server side rendering) is
considered in this project and you only have to deal with server to exchange pure data.

3)according to the aforementioned point, all routing are handled using vue which means routing are handled on the client side
and regarding this issue I have included examples and code samples on the client code so you can find out how the thigns are working down there.

more hints will be added here as project goes on!
